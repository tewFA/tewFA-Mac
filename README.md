### Important info
Exporting your tokens is not possible in this version due to limitations. It's suggested to simply create your tokens on the web version and import them to Mac for use everywhere.

### Running the app
As I don't have a paid developer account, this app is not notarized.
If you have issues running the app, try referring to this article -> https://appleinsider.com/inside/macos/tips/how-to-launch-any-macos-app-even-those-not-notarized-by-apple
